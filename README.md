wp-migration
============

Migrate your wordpress form one server to another

Very often I have to migrate Wordpress site from a development server to a production server or from pre production server to the production server.
Repeating this task over and over ... So I decided to put all these steps in a very simple script.

This script is tested under Ubuntu 10.04 and 12.04, you might need to adapt the script to make it work in your favorite Linux distro.
